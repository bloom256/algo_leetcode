<ul>
<li><strong>Task:</strong> There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and
all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all
the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its
key. When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it.
Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can
take all of them with you to unlock the next rooms. Given an array rooms
where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited
room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false
otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>Task summary:</strong> Determine if all rooms can be visited
starting from room 0.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Use BFS or DFS starting from room 0. Keep
track of visited rooms in a set. At the end, if the size of the visited
set equals the total number of rooms, return true; otherwise, return
false.</li>
<li><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(N + E) where N is the number of
rooms and E is the total number of keys.</li>
<li><strong>Space complexity:</strong> O(N) for the visited set and the
queue/stack.</li>
</ul>
