<h2 id="binary-tree">Binary Tree</h2>
<h3 id="dfs">DFS</h3>
<h4 id="maximum-depth-of-binary-tree">Maximum Depth of Binary Tree</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recursive DFS:</strong> The depth of a node is
<code>1 + max(left_depth, right_depth)</code>. The base case is a null
node, which has a depth of 0. Time: O(N), where N is the number of
nodes, as we visit each node once. Space: O(H), where H is the height of
the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree),
this can be O(N).</li>
<li><strong>Iterative DFS:</strong> Use a stack to store pairs of
<code>(node, depth)</code>. Start with the root and a depth of 1. While
the stack is not empty, pop a node, update the maximum depth found so
far, and push its children with an incremented depth. Time: O(N). Space:
O(H), for the stack.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="invert-binary-tree">Invert Binary Tree</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recursive DFS:</strong> For each node, swap its left and
right children, then recursively call the function for the left and
right children. The base case is a null node. Time: O(N), Space:
O(H).</li>
<li><strong>Iterative DFS:</strong> Use a stack. Push the root. While
the stack is not empty, pop a node, swap its children, then push the new
right and left children if they exist. Time: O(N), Space: O(H).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="same-tree">Same Tree</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iterative DFS:</strong> Use two stacks, one for each tree.
Push the roots onto their respective stacks. While both stacks are not
empty, pop a node from each. If one node is null and the other isn’t, or
if their values are different, the trees are not the same. Then, push
the left and right children of both nodes onto their stacks. If the
stacks are both empty at the end, the trees are the same. Time: O(N),
Space: O(H).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="symmetric-tree">Symmetric Tree</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iterative DFS with Two Stacks:</strong> Use two stacks. Push
the root onto both stacks. While the stacks are not empty, pop a node
from each. If one node is null and the other isn’t, or if their values
are different, the tree is not symmetric. For the first stack, push the
left then the right child. For the second stack, push the right then the
left child. If the stacks are both empty at the end, the tree is
symmetric. Time: O(N), Space: O(H).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="path-sum">Path Sum</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Iterative DFS. Use a
<code>std::vector</code> as a stack to store pairs of
<code>(node, prev_sum)</code>. A leaf is a node where both its left and
right children are null. In each iteration, calculate
<code>curr_sum = prev_sum + node-&gt;val</code>. If the current node is
a leaf, compare <code>curr_sum</code> to the <code>targetSum</code>. If
they are equal, a path is found. If the loop finishes without finding a
path, return false.</li>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(N), as each node is visited
once.</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(H) in a balanced tree, where H
is the height. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this can be
O(N).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bst">BST</h3>
<h4 id="search-in-a-binary-search-tree">Search in a Binary Search
Tree</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Start at the root. While the current
node is not null, compare its value with the target. If they match,
return the node. If the target is smaller, move to the left child;
otherwise, move to the right child. If the loop finishes, the value is
not in the tree.</li>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(H), where H is the height of the
tree. For a balanced tree, this is O(log N). In the worst case of a
skewed tree, it’s O(N).</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1) for the iterative
approach.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="insert-into-a-binary-search-tree">Insert into a Binary Search
Tree</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> If the root is null, create a new node
and return it. Otherwise, start with <code>curr = root</code>. Loop as
long as <code>curr</code> is not null. If the new value is less than
<code>curr</code>’s value, check if <code>curr</code>’s left child is
null. If it is, insert the new node there and break the loop. Otherwise,
move to the left child. If the new value is greater than
<code>curr</code>’s value, check if the right child is null. If it is,
insert the new node there and break. Otherwise, move to the right child.
Return the original root.</li>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(H), where H is the height of the
tree. For a balanced tree, this is O(log N). In the worst case of a
skewed tree, it’s O(N).</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1) for the iterative
approach.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="validate-binary-search-tree">Validate Binary Search Tree</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Use an iterative DFS approach with a
stack. The stack stores tuples of <code>(node, min_val, max_val)</code>.
Start by pushing the root onto the stack with negative and positive
infinity as the initial min and max bounds. While the stack is not
empty, pop a node. If the node is null, continue. Check if the node’s
value is outside its valid range (<code>&lt;= min</code> or
<code>&gt;= max</code>); if so, the tree is invalid. Then, push the left
child onto the stack with an updated max bound of the current node’s
value, and push the right child with an updated min bound of the current
node’s value. If the loop completes, the tree is a valid BST.</li>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(N), as we visit each node
once.</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(H), where H is the height of
the tree, for the stack.</li>
</ul>
